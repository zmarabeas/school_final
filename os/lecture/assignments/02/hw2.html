Do every problem by yourself. <b> Do NOT </b> search for solutions  from internet, previous classes or other students.  </p><p>

</p><ol> 

Read Sec. 2.1 and Sec. 2.2 before you start the problems. <p> <br>


</p><li> (10 pts) (Problem 2.9.) Assume that you are trying to download a
 large 2-GB file from the Internet. The file is available from a set of 
mirror servers, each of which can deliver a subset of the file's bytes; 
assume that a given request specifies the starting and ending bytes of 
the file.  Explain how you might use threads to improve the download 
time. <p> <br>

</p></li><li> (10 pts) Write a multithread C program to count the number
 of prime numbers within a given range [low,high] (inclusive), where the
 program should be able to take in the number of threads as an argument.
 You may use this single thread <a href="https://lihaoxu.eng.wayne.edu/Courses/CSC4420/Note/prime_cnt2.c"> program </a> in anyway you like. ( Here is a <a href="https://lihaoxu.eng.wayne.edu/Courses/CSC4420/Homework/prime_cnt8"> reference implmentation </a> ( executable only ), and you can check your results against this one to see if they match. ) <p>
<br>
</p></li><li> (10 pts) Write a simple test program to find out the <em> parent process id </em> of a process <b> before</b> and <b>after</b>
 its parent process terminates. Based on your test results, answer the 
following question: what is a process's parent process after its 
original parent process terminates? <p>
<br>

</p></li><li> (10 pts) Write a simple test program to find out PIDs of 
ALL ancestor (i.e., parent, grandparent ) processes of the current 
process or a given process specified by a PID. A parent process's PID of
 a given process pid can be found in /proc/$pid/status  <p>
<br>


</p></li><li> (20 pts) Problem 1.35. Run the program on your <b> OWN </b>
 laptop/desktop, and record the maximum number of child processes you 
see before your system crashes, as well as your machine's memory size. <p>
( For those who doesn't have this edition of the textbook, the problem 
is as follows: If you have a personal UNIX-like system available that 
you can safely crash and reboot, write a shell script that attempts to 
create an unlimited number of child processes and observe what happens. 
Before running the experiment, type sync to the shell to flush the file 
system buffers to disk to avoid ruining the file system. ) </p><p>

Again, do <b> NOT </b> run the experiment on any shared system. You can write a C/C++ program instead of shell script for this experiment. Do <b> NOT </b>
 search for solutions. ( There is one on internet, but I doubt you would
 understand it, otherwise you wouldn't need to take this course now. ) </p><p>

<br>

</p></li><li> (20 pts) Design and run an experiment to measure the CPU time used by <em> fork </em>. ( You may want to use
the system call <em> times </em>. ) Also report the CPU of the machine you run the experiment. <p>
