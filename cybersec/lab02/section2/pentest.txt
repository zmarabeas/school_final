Security Penetration Test

Target: Web Applications and Network Infrastructure with HTTP/2 and SSL/TLS Services

Purpose: Identify high-severity vulnerabilities in web servers, SSL/TLS implementations, and network services that could be exploited for denial of service attacks or man-in-the-middle attacks

Scope: HTTP/2 enabled web services, OpenSSL implementations, and SSL VPN infrastructure

Summary of findings:

1. CVE-2023-44487 - HTTP/2 Rapid Reset Attack
   Severity: High (CVSS 7.5)
   Issue: HTTP/2 protocol vulnerability allowing massive DDoS attacks through stream multiplexing abuse. Attackers send numerous requests followed by immediate RST_STREAM frames, causing substantial server-side resource consumption. This vulnerability enabled record-breaking DDoS attacks exceeding 398 million requests per second.
   Remediation: Apply HTTP/2 patches from vendors, implement rate limiting on stream creation, consider disabling HTTP/2 if not required, and deploy DDoS protection services.

2. CVE-2024-12797 - OpenSSL Raw Public Keys Vulnerability
   Severity: High
   Issue: TLS/DTLS connections using RFC7250 raw public keys fail to properly authenticate servers, enabling man-in-the-middle attacks. Affects OpenSSL 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 versions where attackers can intercept and manipulate encrypted communications.
   Remediation: Upgrade to OpenSSL versions 3.2.4, 3.3.2, or 3.4.1. Disable raw public key usage if not required and implement certificate pinning for critical connections.

3. CVE-2024-40766 - SonicWall SSL VPN Access Control Bypass
   Severity: Critical (CVSS 9.3)
   Issue: Access control bypass vulnerability in SonicWall SSL VPN allowing unauthorized access and potential firewall crashes leading to network outages. Actively exploited in the wild with confirmed attacks.
   Remediation: Apply SonicWall security patches immediately, implement network segmentation, enable additional authentication factors, and monitor VPN access logs for suspicious activity.

Conclusion:

All three vulnerabilities present significant risks to organizational security infrastructure. The HTTP/2 Rapid Reset vulnerability enables unprecedented DDoS attacks, while the OpenSSL and SonicWall vulnerabilities compromise encrypted communications and network access controls. Immediate patching and configuration hardening are critical to prevent exploitation. Organizations should prioritize these remediations based on their exposure to HTTP/2 services, OpenSSL usage, and SonicWall VPN deployments.
