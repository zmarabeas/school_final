Security Penetration Test

Target: RDP Service (172.16.0.10:3389) and SSL/TLS Infrastructure

Purpose: Identify cryptographic vulnerabilities in SSL/TLS implementations using weak cipher suites

Scope: SSL/TLS services supporting legacy 64-bit block ciphers on network services

Summary of findings:

1. CVE-2016-2183 - SSL Medium Strength Cipher Suites Supported (SWEET32)
   Severity: High (CVSS 7.5)
   Issue: 3DES cipher suites vulnerable to birthday attacks enabling plaintext recovery. Attackers capture 32GB encrypted traffic from long-lived TLS sessions to recover authentication tokens within 40 hours. Affects systems using DES-CBC3-SHA cipher.
   Remediation: Disable 3DES cipher suites. Configure "SSLCipherSuite HIGH:MEDIUM:!MD5:!RC4:!3DES" for Apache or run "Disable-TlsCipherSuite -Name 'TLS_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA'" for Windows. Use AES-based ciphers only.

Conclusion:

3DES cipher support enables practical cryptanalytic attacks against encrypted communications. The SWEET32 vulnerability allows authentication token recovery from captured traffic. Immediate cipher suite reconfiguration required to eliminate this attack vector.
